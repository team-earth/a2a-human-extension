# A2A Human-Aligned Extension



This repository proposes a structured extension to Google's [Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol](https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/specification/) to support real-world, human-led programs and institutions using the G-O-S-R model (Goal ← Obstacles ← Solutions ← Resources).

It defines agent structures like `ProgramCard`, `ParticipationTemplate`, and `operating_character` blocks—enabling civic and institutional actors to participate meaningfully in agent ecosystems alongside AI-based agents.

> **About Google A2A**  
> The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is an open, draft specification introduced by Google on April 9, 2025. It enables software agents—including AI models and automated systems—to communicate, share tasks, and coordinate action in a structured, interoperable way across platforms and organizations.

> **Why does A2A matter?**  
> A2A defines a shared language for software agents to collaborate automatically. This extension brings human-led programs—such as nonprofits, civic groups, and public institutions—into that ecosystem, enabling meaningful coordination between AI and real-world initiatives.

## 🔍 Purpose

- Extend A2A protocol to represent human-aligned entities  
- Support structured discovery and collaboration via AgentCards  
- Encode motivational, communicative, and governance metadata using recognized frameworks (e.g. Spiral Dynamics, Hofstede)
