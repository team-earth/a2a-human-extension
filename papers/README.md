### Abstract

This paper introduces a human-aligned extension to Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling human-led programs and civic initiatives to participate meaningfully in AI agent ecosystems. The extension uses the G-O-S-R model (Goal ← Obstacles ← Solutions ← Resources) to structure institutional and civic actors alongside AI-based agents.
